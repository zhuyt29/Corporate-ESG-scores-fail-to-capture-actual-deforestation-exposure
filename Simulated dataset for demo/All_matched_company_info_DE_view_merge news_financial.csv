In FY2020, 3M generated USD 32.1 bn in revenue through four segments: safety and industrial, transportation and electronics, healthcare, and consumer. More than 50% of the company's revenue comes from outside the US, with the safety and industrial segment (36.5%) accounting for the largest share of the firm's net sales in 2020.?  3M has a highly diversified product portfolio of over 55,000 products. Any quality issue or safety defect could result in costly product recalls and lawsuits. These issues can also result in a loss of customer confidence, potentially leading to lower sales. Additionally, 3M¡¯s large production volumes and global customer base expose the company to risks from complying with several compliance and accounting regulations in different regions. The company is also exposed to corruption risks as it is involved in projects with governments who are both customers and regulators. Lastly, through its manufacturing operations and the use of solvent-based substances, 3M generates large amounts of VOC emissions and toxic effluents. The company may face higher remediation costs to clean polluted sites and lawsuits from local regulators if it fails to comply with legal requirements.

As of year-end 2018, AAK had 20 production facilities and customization plants. AAK caters to a variety of industries and sectors that, through their products, reach millions of consumers worldwide. Some of these, such as the infant, medical and senior nutrition sectors target a particularly vulnerable consumer group, which underlines quality and safety issues as an area of exposure for AAK. Furthermore, AAK has an extensive network of production and customization facilities worldwide, which add up to an energy and carbon intensive operation. Failure to integrate green technologies into its processes could translate into lost cost saving opportunities. Additionally, oils and fats are consistently named among the main culprits for obesity and cardiovascular diseases.

(AGL) is one of Australia's largest producers and retailers of  electricity and gas, servicing 3.95 million residential and business customers,  or about one-third of the Australian market  as of FY2020. Its 11.2GW generation capacity comprises a portfolio of  base-load, peaking and intermediate generation plants across traditional  thermal generation as well as renewable sources. Australia has one of the world¡¯s most carbon-intensive energy systems,  with electricity generation representing about one-third of the country¡¯s  footprint. AGL is Australia¡¯s largest GHG emitter, generating 85% of its  electricity output from coal. The company is therefore highly exposed to  material carbon-related risks. AGL¡¯s asset portfolio is scheduled to undergo a  significant shift from coal power to renewables, as well as peaking and storage  capacity over the coming decades. During this transition period,  decommissioning and rehabilitation of operations coupled with development of  new projects expose the company to potential community relations issues.  Moreover, AGL operates power stations which emit non-carbon air pollutants and  generate contaminating waste, exposing it to risks from environmental incidents  and potential non-compliance with regulatory requirements. The company's overall exposure is high and is moderately above subindustry average. Carbon - Own Operations, Emissions, Effluents and Waste and Community Relations  are notable material ESG issues. AGL has a board  committee that oversees strategy, management and performance on material ESG  issues, linked to executive remuneration.

AGL has set out plans for  gradual decommissioning of all its coal-fired plants by 2050, with the first  scheduled for 2023.

AXA is one of world¡¯s largest asset managers in FY2019, with EUR 969 bn in assets under management for its insurance companies, their clients and third parties. It has 160,000 employees in 57 countries, serving 108 million clients. AXA plans to use its existing opportunities in Asia to take advantage of the growing middle class, where demand for insurance products is increasing. The expansion into countries that score poorly on Transparency International¡¯s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) may test AXA¡¯s commitment to Business Ethics. The dynamics of the health insurance market, including potential rises in pandemics and changing life expectancies, will bring new challenges to the group¡¯s already developed ESG Integration efforts. It also faces exposures to climate change on the liability and asset sides of its balance sheets. According to broker Willis Towers Watson, re/insurers will face COVID-19 claims ranging between USD 30 bn to USD 97 bn.

Although the company has a moderate level of controversies, its favourable risk assessment is primarily due to its above average policies and programmes. Japan-based  Asahi Group Holdings (Asahi) manufactures and markets alcoholic beverages and  soft drinks in Japan and overseas. Its main segments are: alcoholic beverages (40.5%  of FY2019 revenue), soft drinks (17.2%), food (5.4%; includes mints, baby food  and freeze-dried food) and overseas (32%; includes alcoholic and non-alcoholic  beverages). The company has been expanding its overseas businesses through  M&A. Recently, it acquired European beer brands Peroni, Grolsch and  Pilsner Urquell. Water is an  important resource for Asahi¡¯s beer brewing activities, as well as for its soft  drinks and food manufacturing. The company¡¯s ability to manage water resources can  have a significant impact on its operations. Furthermore, as a food and  beverage producer, the company is expected to manage risks associated with  product quality and safety. Quality and safety issues, such as food  contamination, could result in reputational damage as well as potential  lawsuits by consumers. The company also needs to manage its exposure to the  societal health impact of its alcoholic products, as well as adhere to various  regional marketing standards related to the sale of alcoholic beverages.  The company's overall exposure is medium and is similar to subindustry average. Product Governance, Resource Use and E&S Impact of Products and Services  are notable material ESG issues. Asahi's  Global Sustainability Committee is chaired by the company's CEO and is responsible  for formulating the group's sustainability policy, determining the  sustainability strategy and making investment decisions regarding  sustainability. The company works to reduce its water use by decreasing the water  that it uses at its manufacturing facilities and promoting water reuse. The  majority of Asahi¡¯s facilities have received food safety certifications.  However, the company did experience one product recall in 2019. In terms of its  product mix, the company is gradually increasing the percentage of non-alcohol  product sales.

Notably, its overall risk is higher since it is materially exposed to more ESG issues than most companies in our universe. Despite its strong management policies and programmes, the company has experienced a high level of controversies. BASF, headquartered in Germany, is the worldâ€™s largest chemical company in terms of sales value. In 2020, BASF derived its sales of EUR 59.1 billion from five business segments: surface technologies (28% of sales), materials (18%), chemicals (14%), industrial solutions (13%), agricultural solutions (13%) and nutrition & care (11%). While as of 2020, the company derived around half of its sales from Europe, BASF is investing in rapidly growing emerging markets, including China.   BASF competes in almost every chemical product category, including commodity, specialty, and agricultural chemicals. Since the products it offers often contain substances hazardous to human health or the environment, BASF needs to ensure compliance with a variety of regulations focusing on the negative environmental or social impact of its products. Moreover, the companyâ€™s manufacturing processes may generate toxic waste or release hazardous emissions into the air and water, if appropriate water and emissions filtering systems are not in place. Lastly, the companyâ€™s operations are highly energy intensive, resulting in the release of GHG emissions. BASF is therefore exposed to increasingly stringent carbon regulations and policies, which can increase the companyâ€™s operational costs. China, where BASF is investing heavily, launched a carbon trading system in February 2021. The company's overall exposure is medium and is moderately below subindustry average. Carbon - Own Operations, Emissions, Effluents and Waste and E&S Impact of Products and Services  are notable material ESG issues. BASF has a corporate sustainability board, which is responsible for the companyâ€™s sustainability strategy, initiatives, and targets. Additionally, the performance bonus for members of the Board of Executive Directors takes into consideration whether strategic targets, including sustainability-related targets, are met. However, the company does not disclose the weight that these criteria have on overall compensation.

BRF SA is the largest poultry and pork producer in Brazil and the world's largest exporter of chicken meat selling over 4,000 products. Its main segments are ""in natura"" (poultry, pork, bovine, and other), processed foods, and other sales. While the company is present in over 130 countries worldwide, 43% of BRF¡¯s net sales originated within Brazil in FY19. The Middle East (Halal segment) and Asia (International) are BRF¡¯s main export markets accounting for 36% and 21% of net sales respectively.  For BRF to maintain its market share, it must uphold strong food safety measures, which are critical to maintaining customer trust. Meat is quality sensitive and at high risk of contamination during the product processing and transportation phase, while the livestock is at risk of infection and disease. Moreover, BRF¡¯s main export markets being its halal segment supplying the UAE and its international market catering to Asia, are both particularly sensitive to quality standards. Companies have been incentivized to resort to bribery or corruption to ensure that their products pass safety inspections, which often result in significant penalties if detected.

As of FY2019,  the company operates approximately 64 factories and specialty plants and sells  its products to customers in 140 countries worldwide. Barry¡¯s risk exposure  stems from its reliance on cocoa, a commodity that has been historically linked  to child labour and forced labour. Despite the industry¡¯s ongoing efforts,  government agencies and NGOs estimate that about 2.1 million children work on  cocoa farms in Ivory Coast and Ghana as a result of poverty. Reliance on a  commodity exposed to systemic human rights issues creates risks that the  company should manage to avoid potential reputational damage and lawsuits. As Barry operates in the B2B segment with products sold to food  manufacturing companies accounting for 66% of sales volume as of FY2019, similar  to last year, it is important to meet customers??strict food quality, health  and safety requirements.

Following  the acquisition of Monsanto in July 2018, the company has been steadily  increasing the revenues derived from its agrochemical business, which rose from  28% in FY2017 to 45.5% in FY2019.  Bayer has the highest ESG exposure within the pharma subindustry. This  is driven by the unique features of its business model, namely its agrochemical  business. By acquiring Monsanto in July 2018, Bayer inherited certain risks typical of agrochemical  companies. Therefore, Bayer not only increased its  exposure to Emissions, Effluents and Waste, and Occupational Health and Safety,  but it also acquired a controversy related to Monsanto¡¯s non-selective  herbicide, Roundup, which has negative impacts on stakeholders and poses severe  risks. This idiosyncratic issue, Social Impact of Products, which contributes  12% of Bayer¡¯s overall exposure, significantly increases legal (exponential  increasing the trend of liability lawsuits filed against Bayer), regulatory (uncertainty  around glyphosate licensing in the EU) and operational risks (Roundup is estimated  to account for 8% of FY2019 revenues).  The company's overall exposure is high and is significantly above subindustry average. Occupational Health and Safety, Emissions, Effluents and Waste and Product Governance  are notable material ESG issues.

The company reported EUR 1.79 bn in net income, EUR 248.6 bn in assets and had over 15,100 employees at the end of FY2019. Its main business streams are insurance (84%), asset management (8%) and banking products (8%). In April 2020, NN Group completed the acquisition of Vivatâ€™s non-life insurance business, becoming the largest Dutch non-life insurer. In the past few years, insurance companies have faced significant challenges to their traditional revenue streams. These include the shift towards increased digital access, user telematics tracking and the emergence of â€œinsurtechsâ€? which challenge established operating models by offering consumers more choice in coverage options (such as hourly coverage and consumer incentives that can lower premiums). The growth in digital platforms and telematics also raises scrutiny over data security, as the vast amount of data collected can become a prime target for data breaches, a major risk for companies like NN Group. ESG awareness is also on the rise; a report by consultancy firm Opimas notes that asset managers are increasingly adopting ESG data in their strategies, especially in Europe. This suggests that asset managers not incorporating ESG data may fall out of favour with investors. The company's overall exposure is medium and is similar to subindustry average. ESG Integration - Financials, Product Governance and Data Privacy and Security  are notable material ESG issues. NN Group is a customer-focused company. It incorporates impact and risk assessments into product development and makes customer experience and suitability components in variable remuneration for executive compensation. Cybersecurity is also a fundamental part of NN Groupâ€™s risk management strategy, where each business unit is assigned a cybersecurity team, plus encryption and authentication mechanisms to secure data. However, there is no evidence of regular vulnerability testing of its systems and NN Group was reportedly involved in a recent case of unauthorized sharing of customer information. The company demonstrates its commitment to sustainable and responsible finance by adhering to comprehensive policies and programmes, engaging with investee companies and policymakers and encouraging positive change. There are also notable measures to mitigate climate risks in its operations.

In FY2019, 67% of the company¡¯s revenues were derived from international operations.

German-based company Evonik produces specialty chemicals used in consumer products and construction, but also as material solutions for energy-efficient products in the automotive industry. The company operates four business segments: nutrition and care (31% of FY2018 revenues); resource efficiency (38%); performance materials (26%); and services (5%). In FY2018, Evonik¡¯s sales amounted to EUR 15,024 mn (USD 16,357 mn). In February 2020, Evonik acquired PeroxyChem for USD 640 mn.

Through its automotive segment, Ford markets passenger cars, trucks, vans and light commercial vehicles, as well as parts and accessories. The company¡¯s financial services segment provides financing products for the purchase of new and used vehicles and its mobility segment develops emerging mobility services. Ford sold 5.4 million vehicles in FY2019 (5.6% of global market share). Considering the recent increase in product recalls due to higher regulatory scrutiny -especially in the US, where Ford held a 14% market share in FY2019- ensuring the quality and safety of its product offering is paramount for Ford. If unmitigated, related risks may include costly recalls, compensation costs and fines. Also, as the company is exiting the passenger car segment in the US market, its heavy reliance on sales of pickup trucks and SUVs exposes Ford to higher costs of compliance with stricter emissions standards. A relatively late electrification of its fleet exacerbates such exposure. Also, Ford operates in a labour-intensive industry that is increasingly reliant on highly qualified employees with specialized skills, including IT talent. Related risks could include legal disputes with unions, production disruptions, or inability to innovate due to retention issues.

As a market maker, the company is able to quote two-sided prices, which can lead to price manipulation. This additional risk results in HSBC having a higher exposure than the industry. HSBC¡¯s involvement in numerous litigations exposes it to legal and reputational risks but as it resolves its legacy controversies these risks are decreasing.

These  issues are also covered by the principles and criteria of the Roundtable on  Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), the industry¡¯s main sustainability certification  body. RSPO certification is often a condition for buyers and financers of palm  oil companies. Non-compliance with RSPO criteria can lead to suspension, which  can result in buyers and financers ceasing to do business with a company, as  IOI experienced in 2016 when it was suspended by the RSPO violating its  standards.

Itochu Corporation (Itochu), is a Japanese sogo-shosha (general trading company) that trades in a wide range of products and materials, and invests in strategic business projects globally. Its consolidated revenue in FY2017 amounted to JPY 5,510.1 bn (approximately USD 50.1 bn). While its Metals and Minerals business segment drove net profit growth in FY2017 (approximately 20% of the consolidated net profit), the company also has a competitive advantage in non-resource business sectors. Japanese sogo-shosha, unlike trading companies in other countries, do business not only as intermediaries, but also engage in investment in entire value chain. In particular, as they are engaged in public infrastructure development in emerging countries, where there are high levels of concerns on corruption in the public sector are significant, the risks related to business ethics are relatively high for them. In addition, although its stable business growth is underpinned by the strength in non-resources sector, Itochu is exposed to risks of community oppositions in its investment in energy & chemicals businesses. Furthermore, with a global business network of a total of 103 units overseas, development of highly skilled and capable human capital is essential, in order to identify potential risks and business opportunities in its diverse and fast-changing business environment. The company's overall exposure is low and is similar to subindustry average. Human Capital, Business Ethics and Community Relations  are notable material ESG issues. Itochu has established the Sustainability Committee at executive/senior management level, chaired by the Chief Administrative Officer. While the committee is considered to play an effective role in decision making and implementation of Sustainability Action Plans of Itochu Group, the limited expertise in sustainability issues at the board level is an area of concern. Room for improvement in its ESG governance also includes linking executive compensation to sustainability performance targets that go beyond compliance with laws and regulations. The company periodically publishes an integrated report, in which the company has identified its material ESG issues at group level and the issues are clearly linked to core business drivers. In addition, Itochu also discloses seven different Sustainability Action Plans in the report, each of which are dedicated to the core companies of the group.

JBS SA (JBS) is a manufacturer, distributer and marketer  of animal products globally (primarily beef, poultry and pork).

For JBS to maintain its market share, it must uphold strong food safety measures, which are critical to maintaining customer trust. Meat is quality sensitive and at high risk of contamination during the product processing phase, while the livestock is at risk of infection and disease.

Macquarie is one of Australia¡¯s leading financial institutions, employs over 15,000 people across 31 countries, and operates in regulated markets and industries. Most of the group¡¯s operations are in mature markets, but to propel growth the company is pursuing opportunities in new products and geographies, particularly in Asia.

In addition, through its investment in mineral resources development and energy projects, Marubeni is exposed to the significant climate change risks in its operation.

However, these segments are energy-intensive, increasing reputational and regulatory risks related to carbon reduction. To reduce its dependence on commodities, the firm has developed new growth opportunities, such as artificial intelligence and healthcare. Its diverse and vast number of business units has led to a global workforce of over 40,000 employees, making the development of highly skilled and capable human capital essential. Additionally, regulatory risks related to business ethics are material, as it is engaged in public infrastructure development in emerging countries where corruption is a concern. The company's overall exposure is medium and is similar to subindustry average. Carbon - Own Operations, Business Ethics and Human Capital  are notable material ESG issues. As an advocate for a low-carbon economy, Mitsui aims to reduce its annual energy consumption by 1% for its head office and Japanese subsidiaries. Notable carbon reduction initiatives include commitments not to grow its thermal coal business and to build new energy businesses, such as alternative fuels. Yet, it is unclear if such initiatives are carried out on a consolidated basis, as there is no formal carbon reduction policy in place. To maintain its diverse and global business, strong human resource functions are crucial. Robust human capital initiatives, like mobile working schemes, and diversity management, including flexible working hours, have contributed to a low employee turnover rate. In addition, Mitsui has established bribery and corruption programmes, with internal monitoring systems to detect corruption, but it lacks a formal anti-corruption policy.

(Navigator) is an integrated forest producer, whose end products are uncoated woodfree paper (53% of FY2019 revenue before elimination), Pulp (14%), Tissue paper (5%) and Others (forestry, pellets, 27%). In FY2019, Navigator managed 108,269 hectares of forests in Portugal, out of which 74% were occupied by eucalyptus and had 356,210 hectares under concession in Mozambique. Navigator owns and operates four large-scale industrial complexes in Portugal, being exposed to various environmental risks. The production of pulp and paper generates liquid by-products such as black liquor, whose spill could pollute nearby waters, triggering fines, permit suspension and clean-up costs. In addition, chemical and mechanical processes producing pulp and paper use vast amounts of fresh water. Given that droughts tend to be more frequent in the context of climate change, failure to increase the water efficiency of its operations could expose Navigator to freshwater withdrawal restrictions and operational disruptions. Moreover, the company¡¯s operations bear a notable carbon-footprint.

Neste Oyj  (Neste) is a Finnish oil refining and retail company. The company operates  through three business segments: Renewable Products, Oil Products, and  Marketing & Services. Roughly two-thirds of Neste¡¯s revenue in FY2019 was  attributed to the sale of oil products. Over 80% of the company¡¯s sales were generated  within Europe, with diesel and gasoline accounting for over half of products  sold. Neste¡¯s renewable product offerings include renewable diesel, jet fuel  and polymers. While Neste can  be considered an oil refiner and retailer at its core, its business model is  distinctly unique compared to traditional European and American downstream  players, given its focus on renewable fuel production. Although this  significantly reduces its vulnerability to transitional risks associated with  the global movement towards low-carbon energy, it also generates exposure in  other ESG areas like resource use and responsible sourcing. Neste¡¯s use of palm  oil within its renewable products business segment can be a particularly significant driver of  risk through controversies, especially if the company does not maintain strong  due diligence across its supply chain. Other ESG areas, such as workplace  safety and environmental management, can also pose risks to Neste, given the  strict regulatory environment of most Scandinavian countries.

(Nippon Paper) is a pulp and paper manufacturer with a portfolio of products and services spanning various business domains: Paper and paperboard (69.1% of FY2018/2019 net sales), Livelihood (packaging, household paper; 18.9%), Wood products and construction (5.6%), Energy (3.4%) and Others (3%). In March 2019, Nippon Paper acquired 70% of shares in TS Plastics Sdn. Bhd., a flexible packaging company in Malaysia, thus expanding to Asian markets. In FY2018/2019, the company owned 173,000 hectares of afforestation lands in Japan and overseas. The use of afforestation plantations composed predominately of eucalyptus and acacia in water scarce regions, such as South Africa, Brazil or Chile, where the company has operations, may be a source of community conflict and regulatory risks. In addition, Nippon Paper has a water reliant manufacturing processes, exposing the company to water usage restrictions. Moreover, extensive energy requirements in the pulp and paper manufacturing business and the company¡¯s desire to grow its energy units exposes it to emissions regulations. Furthermore, the processing of wood products into paper products requires multiple chemical additives and produces solid, liquid and airborne wastes. Mismanagement in these two areas could trigger increased stakeholder scrutiny or environmental fines. The company's overall exposure is medium and is moderately above subindustry average.

(Olam) engages in farming, direct and indirect sourcing, processing, distribution and trading of agricultural raw materials, food ingredients and packaged foods across over 60 countries. It operates through four segments: Food Staples and Packaged Foods (generating 53.4% of FY2019 revenue), Confectionery and Beverage Ingredients (20.3%), Edible Nuts and Spices (13.4%), and Industrial Raw Materials, Infrastructure and Logistics (12.9%). Olam`s upstream operations include dairy cattle and poultry operations, almond orchards, coffee, rice, cotton and oil palm plantations. In addition, the company engages in the primary processing of agri-commodities, as well as the manufacturing of food and fiber. Farming and processing operations require vast amounts of water; growing water scarcity in many regions exposes the company to operational disruptions and higher water procurement costs. Moreover, Olam¡¯s extensive processing and logistics network result in a notable carbon footprint, with changing climate change regulations worldwide potentially increasing compliance risks.

In FY2018, OLC reported that it reached a new record of 32.56 million guests at its Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea theme parks. Since Japan sees frequent earthquakes and typhoons, regularly ensuring the safety and security of its theme park facilities would help reduce risks stemming from potential accidents and customer lawsuits. Moreover, while Japan is not listed as a high water-stress country, water availability in certain regions varies every year, often leading to regular water shortage. As such, managing OLC¡¯s water resource use across operations could help the company address potential risks.

Repsol is an integrated energy company based in Spain, with over 25,000 employees at the end of FY2019 and with presence in over 34 countries. It has one of the weaker upstream portfolios among its global peers, reporting production of 709,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in FY2019 (64% gas). It also operates a downstream segment with a refining capacity of 1.0 million barrels a day. Repsol¡¯s revenue in FY2019 (USD 55.2 billion) was primarily generated by its downstream operations (90%). The FY2015 acquisition of Talisman Energy expanded Repsol's upstream operations globally, increasing the company's exposure risk to accidental spills and air releases. Moreover, many of its employees face notable health and safety risks due to labour-intensive operations and prolonged exposure to hazardous elements. If management this issue is inadequate, severe accidents can cause injuries, illnesses, and even fatalities, which could disrupt the company's operations. Additionally, given that Repsol generates most of its revenues through its downstream segment, the gradual decline of global demand for fossil fuels presents transitional risks to the company.

Samsung C&T Corporation is an industrial conglomerate engaged in a wide range of activities in over 50 countries. Its business lines include Engineering and construction (plants, civil infrastructure, housing), Trading and investment (trading of industrial commodities and project organizing in infrastructure), Fashion and Resort (resort and golf course operation, food and beverage, landscaping). In FY2018, Samsung C&T derived 50% of revenues from trade. Samsung C&T¡¯s business relations within its value chain, as well as its size and number of countries of operation expose it to ethical breaches. These may include political lobbying, bribery and corruption, tax and accounting irregularities and others. Misconducts could result in financial losses from lawsuits and fines. Furthermore, the company¡¯s diversified service and customer portfolio triggers exposure to quality and safety issues. These could lead to product recalls and lawsuits over product safety or false advertising. Additionally, Samsung C&T¡¯s construction and engineering business segment exposes its employees to workplace hazards and accidents inherent to handling of heavy machinery and working at heights. Mismanagement of health and safety could result in suspension of operations, production disruptions and compensation costs to injured workers or their families.

As of June 2019, the company had over 147,268 employees. Poor working conditions are common among retailers, increasing the risk of labour disputes, which can disrupt operations incurring significant costs. Moreover, as a food retailer, Shoprite uses high amounts of energy for refrigeration of food products, and for the lighting and HVAC systems in its stores.

In 2019, SDP has decided to divest its operations in Liberia and to exit the joint ventures in oleochemical and biomass. SDP is the world¡¯s largest oil palm plantation company by planted area, accounting for around 4% of global crude palm oil (CPO) production. Sustained global demand for palm oil could drive land expansion, displacing communities depending on land for farming and potentially leading to protests and associated operational disruptions.

In addition, Malaysia and Indonesia account for 84% of global production.

The company is also exposed to  carbon-related issues, through land use change allocation and the oxidation of  peat, and its upstream production activities, for instance through methane  emissions from palm oil mills. As one of the world¡¯s largest palm oil  plantation owners, active in Southeast Asia and Western Africa, Wilmar is also  exposed to issues with local communities that live near or on the company¡¯s  estates, meaning the company has to consider the rights of local communities  and indigenous lands.?

In most cases, initiatives should cover at least 50% of  operations in terms of revenue for full scoring on management performance.  While Wilmar has policies and programmes in place that speak to its material  ESG issues, these often apply only to Tropical Oils and Sugar, and not to its  main revenue driver Oilseeds and Grains (50% of revenue in 2019).?

It was formed in 2001 through the merger of several financially troubled banks affected by the Asian financial crisis and became temporarily 100% government-owned after a bailout. Exposure to ethical breaches is mostly derived from the company¡¯s business relations within its value chain, as well as countries of operation and size. These may include political lobbying, conflicts of interest, anti-competitive practices, tax and accounting irregularities and others. The company¡¯s product and service portfolio, as well as its customer base triggers exposure to quality and safety issues. Types of misconduct include unsafe features, insufficient transparency and misleading marketing.

Based in Argentina, YPF Sociedad Anonima (YPF) engages in operating a fully integrated oil and gas chain across the domestic upstream (31.4% of FY2018 revenues), downstream (50.6%), and gas and power (14.7%) segments. Substantially all YPF¡¯s operations, properties and customers are located in Argentina (90% of FY2018 revenues). Additionally, YPF markets lubricants and specialties in Brazil and Chile, and carries out exploration activities in Chile and Bolivia. With a fully integrated business model, YPF operates productive basins, refineries, storage facilities and crude oil and multi-product pipeline networks. Infrastructure integrity issues, such as pipeline ruptures or well blowouts can cause major spills leading to significant fines, clean-up costs and operational disruptions. Moreover, in 2018, Argentina implemented a carbon tax for most liquid fuels which became operational for fuel oil, mineral coal and petroleum coke in 2019. Such regulatory developments joined by fluctuations in demand may impact the company¡¯s earnings, especially if it fails to diversify its offering. In addition, the volatile nature of oil and gas and the remote environments where YPF operates exposes its employees to health and safety incidents. Weak safety protocols may cause employee injury or fatality and can prompt fines and liability lawsuits for YPF. The company's overall exposure is high and is moderately above subindustry average.

Yihai International Holding Ltd (Yihai), together with its subsidiaries, engages in the production and sale of condiments and food products in China (96.3% of FY2019 revenue). Yihai structures its business in four operating segments: Hot pot condiments (65.7% of FY2019 revenue), Ready-to-eat food products (23.3%), Chinese-style compound condiments (9.2%) and Other (e.g. snack food, soya bean oil; 1.8%). Yihai's strategy focuses on expanding its sales network in overseas markets. As a provider of compound condiments and ready-to-eat food products, Yihai faces product contamination risks stemming from potentially flawed manufacturing or storage processes. Incidents could negatively affect customers??health, triggering mass recalls and reputational damage. In addition, Yihai's manufacturing plants, coupled with distribution operations consume notable levels of energy. As carbon regulations tend to become increasingly stringent, they might impact energy prices, exposing Yihai not only to regulatory compliance costs, but also to higher power expenses. Moreover, to maintain its operations, Yihai uses vast quantities of water, especially for washing its stir-frying workshops and for cooling.

Yum China is the largest restaurant company in the country, with over 8,400 restaurants across 1,200 cities as of FY2018. The Chinese market presents unique opportunities and challenges for the Quick-Service Restaurant (QSR) and Casual Dining Restaurant (CDR) segments, with growth driven by consumers that seek both convenience and quality. Yum China is at an advantage given its size and presence. However, restaurants are prone to reputational risks resulting from product governance issues and food safety scandals have significant impact on companies. Furthermore, companies in the industry tend to rely on part-time workers with limited employee benefits and low wages. Managing potential labour risks may limit additional costs associated with the need to hire, train and retain staff with varying levels of skills.
